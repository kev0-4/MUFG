        "content": "The United Arab Emirates is spearheading an ambitious national strategy to preserve and modernise the Arabic language using artificial intelligence. From comprehensive digital dictionaries to AI-powered readability tools and homegrown language models, the UAE's cross-sectoral efforts aim to enhance Arabic’s global digital presence while protecting its cultural and linguistic heritage.\nBuilding a digital future for Arabic: National-level projects\nThe UAE has launched several initiatives across publishing, education, and technology sectors to digitise and modernise the Arabic language. These efforts are backed by prominent institutions, with government support driving integration of AI across platforms and tools.\n- Historical dictionary of the Arabic language:\nDeveloped by the Arabic Language Academy in Sharjah, this project documents the evolution of Arabic through history. It consists of 127 volumes and includes over 20 million words. The dictionary is now available in a GPT-enabled interface, allowing users to explore its vast database interactively. Users can read, write, and even convert content into video, with regular updates and collaborative features enabled through a partnership with the Emirates Scholar Research Centre. - Digital Knowledge Hub:\nRun by the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Knowledge Foundation, this initiative is a centralised platform for digital Arabic content. The Hub has collected 800,000+ titles and 8.5 million digital assets sourced from 18+ libraries. Its purpose is to consolidate Arabic knowledge in a structured digital format and expand global access to Arabic content. - AI-powered dictionary by Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre:\nA landmark tool in digital publishing, this is the first Arabic-English AI dictionary of its kind. It features\n- 7,000+ contemporary Arabic terms\n- AI-based automated pronunciation\n- Simplified, accessible definitions\n- Computational linguistics tools for precision and usability\nThese projects are setting a foundation for future Arabic language learning, content creation, and digital access at a global scale.\nAI meets education and readability: Corpus and learning tools\nThe integration of AI into Arabic language education and research is another central pillar of the UAE's strategy.\n- BAREC (Balanced Arabic Readability Corpus):\nLaunched in 2023 by the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre in partnership with New York University Abu Dhabi and Zayed University, this project aims to collect a 10 million-word linguistic corpus. It includes content from diverse genres and countries, focusing on text readability levels.\nKey objectives of BAREC include:\n- Annotating the corpus using spelling, grammar, and vocabulary complexity\n- Enabling AI tools to automatically assess and classify text readability\n- Supporting Arabic language learning and improving reading comprehension\n- Open-sourcing the data for the research community to enhance Arabic linguistic tools\nReadability, as a concept, plays a crucial role in language acquisition, academic performance, and tailored content delivery—especially important in educational settings.\nFalcon Arabic: UAE’s homegrown AI language model\nThe Technology Innovation Institute (TII), under the Advanced Technology Research Council (ATRC), is leading AI model development with a sharp focus on Arabic.\n- Falcon Arabic:\nUnlike many large language models that rely on translated datasets, Falcon Arabic is built on native Arabic-language data, including Modern Standard Arabic and regional dialects. Its unique value lies in capturing linguistic nuances, cultural context, and regional variation more effectively.\nHighlights of Falcon Arabic:\n- Competes with models up to 10x its size\n- Optimised for performance with reduced computational load\n- Developed entirely within the UAE, reinforcing data sovereignty and localisation\n- Falcon H1:\nA more compact version that reportedly outperforms Meta and Alibaba's comparable models, Falcon H1 maintains high performance with lower technical requirements. Despite a strong start, Falcon models have faced user adoption and ranking challenges compared to global competitors like Meta and DeepSeek (China).\nTII’s broader mission includes AI, quantum computing, robotics, and more. Since its founding in May 2020, it has positioned Abu Dhabi as a regional R&D hub in next-gen tech.\nTechnology in publishing and international collaboration\nThe UAE’s publishing industry is being reimagined with AI at its core.\n- Digital square at Abu Dhabi international Book fair:\nThis new initiative showcases how technology—particularly AI—is reshaping publishing. The space functions as an innovation zone, highlighting the digital transformation of literature, academic texts, and learning materials. - AI in classrooms:\nEducational institutions across the UAE are integrating AI tools in Arabic language instruction. The goal is to future-proof learning environments by combining traditional language preservation with modern digital competency. - International partnerships:\nA major milestone was an AI agreement signed during U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, facilitating Emirati access to advanced American AI semiconductors. This deal has strategic implications, empowering UAE's domestic AI development."

        "content": "Shuo - stock.adobe.com\nAutocratic UAE gets democratic artificial intelligence\nUS-China rivalry has come to a head in authoritarian Gulf state UAE, where OpenAI is attempting to make a stand for democracy and free speech\nOpenAI’s stated plan to stop the spread of tech-driven authoritarianism by helping oppressive Gulf autocracy UAE deliver artificial intelligence (AI) services that uphold democratic values across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia has been met with some skepticism from experts.\nBut the US generative AI (GenAI) firm has declared it is preempting China’s ambition to become a world leader in “autocratic AI” and propagate systems that will help authoritarian states around the world oppress their people, crush dissent, stifle speech and spread propaganda.\nOpenAI said its “Stargate UAE” deal in May was its first act in that endeavour. In collaboration with the US government and the European Union (EU), it was creating a global, “democratically powered AI network”, building infrastructure across 10 countries to run the GPT GenAI models it was building to uphold the principles of democracy, free expression and free markets.\nIn the UAE, that involved building a 1GW datacentre – a site three times larger than the computing power of the entire country, and as much again as was built, being built or planned. Created to serve the government and public sector of one of the most oppressive regimes in the world with services from a “democratic AI” model, it would serve UAE citizens, too, as well as states in a 2,000-mile radius across the Middle East, North and East Africa, South and East Europe, and Central and West Asia, its reach is determined by the point at which communications become so slow that the latency interferes.\nThe Gulf regime may not have committed not to use AI as an instrument of authoritarian control, but Valentin Weber, one of the world’s leading experts on China’s global dissemination of technology designed to empower autocratic rule, believed the OpenAI deal put a line in the sand, forcing the UAE to choose between the US and China.\n“Increasing US involvement in the UAE will dent adoption of Chinese technology in the country,” said Weber, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations.\nBut “the threat of China’s AI in the Middle East is real”, he wrote in an email. “Chinese AI technology that is already deployed is going to persist in UAE public surveillance/security systems for some time.”\nSphere of influence\nThe Stargate deal deepened UAE entanglement in the US technological sphere of influence, which began last year when it severed ties with Huawei, to satisfy Microsoft’s $1.5bn investment in Emirati state-owned AI and datacentre conglomerate G42, said Weber.\nMicrosoft and other US investors had also put $100bn into UAE-state AI investor MGX. The OpenAI deal brought G42 into the partnership, creating Stargate US, Japanese investor Softbank, and US computer firms Nvidia, Oracle and Cisco.\nThe UEA had already agreed to invest $1.4tn in OpenAI’s US Stargate infrastructure and similar projects when US president Donald Trump went to oversee the Stargate UAE deal in May.\nDays before they agreed the investment, lobby group Freedom House ranked the Gulf monarchy among the worst countries in the world for political rights and civil liberties, far below global standards.\nIt is an authoritarian state ruled by powerful families, which punishes political dissent, has no political transparency or independent media, with academia infected with political indoctrination and granted almost no freedom. It represses free expression through surveillance and retribution, dominates people’s political views, and has a corrupt legal system with no independent judiciary, said Freedom House. It has no elections, no right to organise, no tolerance of human rights organisations, and almost no equal opportunity, free movement, female agency, or protection against violence and control at home.\nBy laws it uses to silence journalists, dissidents, activists, government critics and social media users, it has jailed scores of people, Human Rights Watch said in its annual report.\n“UAE has invested a lot in AI, not for democracy, but to deepen its connections with the US and China, and for increased repression, through more efficient online surveillance of journalists, critics, etcetera,” said Jan Völkel, a University of Ottawa professor who monitors the Middle East and North Africa’s political transformation for the Bertelsmann Stiftung foundation. “Modern technology will be used to control and suppress citizens, not to better include their voices in a political process. I don’t see any specific reason to hope for political improvements.”\nRights to freedom\nThe UAE has positioned itself as a global leader in humanitarianism, but that does not include rights to freedom and political participation, nor transparency or judicial independence.\nTechnology has helped make the UAE state security services omnipresent, said the BTI report last year. They monitor media and public spaces for dissent, and punish it with arbitrary and unlimited detention.\nYet the government’s modernisation programme had brought such material benefit to the people of UAE that it created a strong social consensus for its right to govern, and gave the ruling families a high degree of legitimacy. The UAE’s democratic, legal and social structure was feeble, but its economic transformation was phenomenal and its government administration exceptionally competent.\nThe government of Abu Dhabi, where Stargate UAE is being built, said in a press release that its infrastructure would deliver “trusted … safe, secure and responsible AI that delivers long-term benefits for humanity”.\nG42 has announced recent deals to help other governments develop what it calls “responsible AI”, such as in Thailand, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Malaysia.\nBut the UAE was absent at negotiations that led to the world’s first treaty to govern AI systems with democratic, humanitarian and judicial principals last year. Gulf states were welcome to participate but none did so, a Council of Europe spokesperson said. The UK, US and Israel did, and signed it promptly. Ukraine signed it on the same day Trump presided over the Stargate UAE deal.\n“I don’t see why it would be a game-changer,” said the CEO of a global political advisory, who asked not to be named. “OpenAI will be fine-tuned to meet the requirements of the local government. Any restriction to free speech that applies today would also apply to OpenAI.”\nBut they said they didn’t criticise the UAE because it is well run and safe, with good infrastructure.\n“If you are an old democracy like the UK, where you’ve been rich for a long time, you want freedom of speech. But this is not an issue in UAE,” they said. “I know the people, and it’s a fine place. But its goal is not to be a democracy. The goal is to be a place where citizens are richer and enjoy a good life.\n“Standards of living have massively improved since the seventies,” they added. “Some have been educated recently. It will happen, believe me. But at the moment, they’re still very much into being richer, going on holiday, spending more on stuff.”\nRead more about AI in the Middle East\n- Saudi Arabia struggling to reach global leadership in deeptech: Petrostate monarchy trying to build surrogate industry made of foreign startups because own ecosystem is too immature.\n- The Trump administration has pointed to key partnerships, including with the United Arab Emirates and US tech companies, to bolster US. power needs to keep up with AI advances.\n- Microsoft pens artificial intelligence energy deal with United Arab Emirates oil giant ADNOC.\nRafay Systems CEO Haseeb Budhani, who is working with Nvidia and Accenture to build AI systems in the region, said governments had to get the economy right first to improve the lives of citizens.\n“I spend a lot of time in Dubai,” he said. “Life is pretty good here. They’ve thought a lot about how to deliver excellent services, excellent experiences, great roads, great airports. It takes a lot of effort. It takes a lot of time. And similarly in Saudi. That country is moving so fast, and AI has the potential to improve the lives of all the citizenry.”\nGovernments across the Middle East and Asia had been using open source AI models they could run locally because data sovereignty rules stopped them using OpenAI or Anthropic services served from outside the country.\nThey were using Chinese AI models DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen, as well as Meta’s Llama. Telcos, the region’s computing leaders, adopted open source AI to retain their dominance. They did not want to be dependent on OpenAI.\nErnesto Martinez del Pino, a machine learning operations engineer working on AI development in UAE for global consultancy Intellias, said OpenAI was forced to invest in the region because it was losing business in lucrative sectors such as banking, where laws stopped data being transmitted to AI systems outside the country or even outside their own computing infrastructure.\nMost big organisations ran their systems on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which had infrastructure in UAE. But since OpenAI was backed by AWS rival Microsoft, they couldn’t get local access to OpenAI.\nOpenAI, G42 and the UAE governments of Abu Dhabi and Dubai were not prepared to comment."

        "content": "Meta AI takes first step to superintelligence — and Zuckerberg will no longer release the most powerful systems to the public\nThe Meta CEO believes that AI with the capacity to improve itself is the first step towards a technology that will transform humanity.\nResearchers at Meta claim to have observed the company's artificial intelligence (AI) systems improving themselves without human input.\n\"Over the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a policy paper published July 30 on the company's website. \"The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable.\"\nZuckerberg added that self-improving AI is the first step towards achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI) — an artificial intelligence that is capable of surpassing the cognitive abilities of humans.\nBroadly speaking, AI researchers consider AI's capabilities in three strata. While current AI models can achieve extraordinary superhuman feats, like predicting protein structures, these capabilities are extremely narrow. In such cases, the system can only outpace humans in one specific area but lacks general intelligence for this capability to apply across different disciplines.\nThe next tier is called artificial general intelligence (AGI), and refers to models that can understand, learn and adapt in much the same way as the human brain.\nASI is the final state that Zuckerberg referenced in the blog post, and concerns models that have evolved to far exceed human potential — and could improve themselves at an exponential rate, leading to an \"intelligence explosion.\"\nScientists refer to the hypothetical moment that we achieve AGI as the technological singularity.\nGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: AI is entering an 'unprecedented regime.' Should we stop it — and can we — before it destroys us?\nZuckerberg's reference to catching sight of AI self-improvement is not the first time this phenomenon has been spotted. In October 2024, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara published a paper to the preprint arXiv database centered on the notion of self-improvement.\nIn it, they defined, created and tested an AI framework based on the idea of a Gödel Machine — a theoretical device capable of improving itself by rewriting its own code and instructions. Importantly, the machine would only implement a change if it could produce a formal proof that the change would be beneficial.\nThe team experimented with an AI framework based on that concept, and proved that their Gödel Agent could improve its own performance in various tasks, including coding, science, math and reasoning.\nAlmost all models are not typically empowered to rewrite their own code. The Gödel Agent could not only access its entire codebase but also the code used to develop improvements, while showing that those improvements were beneficial.\nThe AI consistently showed better performance in key areas than the human-designed agents to which it was compared, according to the study.Zuckerberg said that ASI could represent a transformative step in humanity's technological progress, and that it could lead to the \"discovery of new things that aren't imaginable today.\"\nThat said, he added that Meta would be far more careful about which models the company chooses to release to the public under an open source framework — meaning anybody could have access to it.\n\"I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress. But perhaps even more important is that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\"As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be.\"\nAlan is a freelance tech and entertainment journalist who specializes in computers, laptops, and video games.
